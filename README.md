__this is my portfolio page__


**By Daniel Hernandez**
---------------------------

Here will be a few projects. The portfolio page itself utilizes tailwind, react, and vite. It is still under construction.


Will update this readme and the project

to get operational locally

```bash
    npm install
```
Then

```bash
    npm run dev
```

This portfolio will start off with 3 webapps and expand later on. It will be a sorting visualizer, a sketch with p5 js, and a mockup of a tech company's webpage
